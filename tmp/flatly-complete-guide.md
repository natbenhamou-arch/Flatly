## üîë KEY FEATURES IN DETAIL

### 1. ONBOARDING FLOW (Multi-Step Profile Creation)

The onboarding is a **7-step wizard** that collects comprehensive user information:

#### Step 1: Welcome Screen (`app/onboarding/index.tsx`)
- Displays Flatly logo and branding
- "Get Started" button to begin onboarding
- Clean gradient background with brand colors

#### Step 2: Full Name (`app/onboarding/full-name.tsx`)
- First name and last name inputs
- Validates that both fields are filled
- Stores in user object

#### Step 3: School & City Selection (`app/onboarding/school-city.tsx`)
**CRITICAL AUTOMATED FEATURE:**
- University search with **autocomplete** from 150+ pre-loaded universities (US, UK, Canada, Europe, Australia)
- **AUTO-CITY SELECTION**: When user selects university, the city is **automatically populated** from the university database
  - Example: Select "Stanford University" ‚Üí City auto-fills to "Stanford"
  - Example: Select "University College London" ‚Üí City auto-fills to "London"
- Database stored in `mocks/universities.ts` with structure:
  ```typescript
  {
    id: 'stanford',
    name: 'Stanford University',
    city: 'Stanford',  // ‚Üê This is used for auto-fill
    country: 'United States',
    domain: 'stanford.edu',
    top500: true
  }
  ```
- Search function: `searchUniversities(query)` filters by name, city, or country
- **Neighborhoods**: After city is confirmed, system loads neighborhood options specific to that city from `NEIGHBORHOODS_BY_CITY` object
  - Example: London ‚Üí ['Camden', 'Shoreditch', 'Notting Hill', 'Kensington', ...]
  - Example: Berkeley ‚Üí ['North Berkeley', 'Downtown Berkeley', 'Southside', ...]

---

### 2. DISCOVER TAB (Swipe Matching)

The core feature where users find potential roommates.

#### UI Components
- **Card Stack**: Shows one user card at a time, with next card slightly visible behind
- **User Card** (`components/UserCard.tsx`):
  - Large profile photo (carousel for multiple photos)
  - Name, age, university
  - City and neighborhood
  - Short bio (240 chars)
  - Compatibility score badge (colored: 85%+ green, 70-84% yellow, <70% orange)
  - Distance indicator (km away)
  - Housing status icon (has room / looking for room)
  - Quick stats: cleanliness, sleep schedule, noise tolerance

#### Swipe Mechanics (PanResponder)
- **Swipe Right (Like)**: Card slides right with rotation, green border flash
- **Swipe Left (Pass)**: Card slides left with rotation, red border flash
- **Tap Card**: Opens full profile modal (see Profile Detail Modal below)
- **Tap Compatibility Score**: Opens compatibility explanation modal
- Animation using React Native's Animated API:
  ```typescript
  pan.setValue({ x: gestureX, y: gestureY })
  opacity.setValue(1 - Math.abs(gestureX) / screenWidth)
  rotation = gestureX / screenWidth * 15deg
  ```

#### Action Buttons (Bottom of screen)
- **Pass Button (X)**: Large pill button, dark gradient, explicitly passes
- **Like Button (Heart)**: Large pill button, blue gradient, explicitly likes
- Both buttons trigger same animations as swipe gestures

#### Feed Algorithm
**The feed is generated in `services/data.ts` by `generateFeed()`:**
1. Fetch all users from database
2. Filter out:
   - Current user
   - Already swiped users (likes + passes)
   - Existing matches
   - Banned users (from admin panel)
   - Users who blocked you
3. Apply preference filters:
   - **City filter**: If cityOnly=true, only show exact city matches
   - **University filter**: If universityFilter=true, only show same university
   - **Age range**: Within user's ageMin-ageMax preference
   - **Distance**: Within maxDistanceKm radius (calculated using geo coordinates)
   - **Recommendation code**: If useRecommendationCode=true, only show users with same code
4. Calculate compatibility score for each remaining user (see Compatibility System below)
5. **Filter by minimum score**: Only show users with score ‚â• 40 (configurable)
6. **Sort by compatibility score**: Highest first
7. Return top 20 users

#### Match Animation
When both users like each other:
1. **Instant match** created in database
2. **Match animation** triggers (`components/MatchAnimation.tsx`):
   - Full-screen overlay
   - Celebratory confetti/particles
   - "IT'S A MATCH!" text with animation
   - Photos of both users slide together
   - "Say Hi üëã" button
3. Navigation to chat screen
4. **Automatic welcome message** sent if enabled in settings

#### Walkthrough (First-time Users)
- Modal overlay with 4 slides explaining:
  1. How to swipe (right=like, left=pass)
  2. How to view full profiles (tap card)
  3. How to create groups (turn match into group chat)
  4. How to manage profile (pause/edit in Profile tab)
- "Next" buttons, dots indicator
- "Got it" on final slide
- Saves `walkthroughSeen: true` to user profile

#### Paused Profile Feature
- Toggle in Profile tab
- When paused:
  - Red banner appears at top: "‚è∏Ô∏è Profile paused ‚Äî You are hidden from Discover"
  - User is **removed from feed** (not shown to others)
  - User can still see feed and pass (but cannot like)
  - Like button disabled with opacity reduced
  - Toast message: "Profile paused" if attempting to like
- Useful for users who found a place or taking a break

## üèÅ CONCLUSION

- Tinder-style discovery
- Advanced AI compatibility
- Rich profile creation
- 1-on-1 and group messaging
- Viewing coordination
- Safety & moderation
- Beautiful mobile-native design

Every question in onboarding counts toward compatibility. The university selection automatically populates the city. Neighborhoods are city-specific. The compatibility algorithm is transparent and explainable. Users can pause their profile anytime. Groups can coordinate viewings together. AI helps with bios and conversation starters. Real photos are supported.

The app is ready for production with minor backend integration (replace mock data with PostgreSQL/Firebase + WebSockets for real-time features).

3. **Neighborhoods are city-specific**
4. **Compatibility is bidirectional** (same for both users)
5. **Match animation triggers on mutual like**
6. **Groups support 2-5 members max**
7. **Paused profiles are hidden from feed**
8. **Profile strength affects match visibility**
9. **AI features have fallbacks** (templates if API fails)
10. **All lists use FlatList** for performance
