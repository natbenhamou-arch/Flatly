## 5. COMPATIBILITY ALGORITHM (AI-POWERED)

**Critical Requirement**: The compatibility algorithm must use AI/LLM to analyze all onboarding data

**How It Works**:
1. When calculating compatibility between two users, send their complete profiles to AI
2. AI analyzes:
   - All lifestyle preferences and slider values
   - Housing needs and budget compatibility
   - Personality indicators (cleanliness, sleep, social habits)
   - Interests and hobby overlap
   - Language and cultural fit
   - Location and university match
   - Values alignment (if shown)
   - Every single onboarding answer

3. AI returns:
   - Compatibility score (0-100)
   - Top 3 specific reasons for the score
   - Explanation of potential conflicts or synergies

**Prompt for AI**:
```
Analyze compatibility between these two potential roommates.
User A: [all profile data]
User B: [all profile data]

Consider:
- Location and university match
- Budget alignment
- Lifestyle habits (cleanliness, sleep, noise, guests)
- Shared interests and hobbies
- Language compatibility
- Values and personality fit
- Housing needs match

Return JSON:
{
  "score": 75,
  "reasons": [
    "üéì Both study at UCLA",
    "üó£Ô∏è Both speak English and Spanish",
    "‚ú® Similar cleanliness expectations"
  ],
  "explanation": "Strong match overall..."
}
```

**Display**:
